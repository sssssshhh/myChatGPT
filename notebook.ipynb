      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 2 cups gluten-free flour blend\n",
      "- 1/2 cup sugar\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon baking powder\n",
      "- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n",
      "- 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce\n",

      "- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n",
      "- 1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a muffin tin with paper liners.\n",
      "2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.\n",
      "3. In a separate bowl, combine the applesauce, vegetable oil, milk, eggs, and vanilla extract.\n",
      "4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.\n",
      "5. Gently fold in the blueberries.\n",
      "6. Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups, filling each about 3/4 full.\n",
      "7. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.\n",
      "8. Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.\n",

      "- Instead of using milk, you can substitute it with any plant-based milk such as almond milk, soy milk, or oat milk. These alternatives work well in baking and will provide moisture to the muffins.\n",

      "- To replace the eggs, you can use a flax egg or a chia egg. To make a flax egg, mix 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed meal with 3 tablespoons of water and let it sit for a few minutes to thicken. For a chia egg, use the same ratio of chia seeds and water. These egg substitutes will help bind the ingredients together in the muffins.\n",
